## IsDigit, IsNumber
``` cs
char c = '\u2160';// 罗马字母一：Ⅰ
Console.WriteLine(c);// output:Ⅰ
Console.WriteLine(char.IsNumber(c));// output:True
Console.WriteLine(char.IsDigit(c));// output False

即IsDigit仅认'0'-'9'这十个字符，而IsNumber范围则广一点。（不过中文“一”还是false）
```

## Universal C Runtime dependency on Windows

With 1.0.0 of .NET Core, all applications that target .NET Core and run on Windows have a Universal CRT (UCRT) dependency. This especially impacts self-contained applications, as it means that the machine that they are to be run on needs to have UCRT installed.

If the dependency is not present, applications will fail to run and errors will be thrown, e.g. The program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-runtime-1-1-0.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem. The UCRT dependency can be installed via Windows Update (name: "Update for Universal C Runtime in Windows", per https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2999226) and, as a recommended update, it will be installed automatically if the user uses the default settings for Windows Update. It can also be downloaded from Microsoft Download Center.
