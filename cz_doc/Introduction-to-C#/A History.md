#A History

The C# programming language was born in 1999 at Microsoft.  The original name was COOL for C-like Object-Oriented Language but it was later changed to C# (pronounced C sharp). 

It was created by Anders Hejlsberg to help address the shortcomings of other programming languages in use at the time.  The language is strongly-typed, object-oriented, and component oriented and utilizes a unified type system.  Unlike C or C++, C# handles memory and resource management for developer, lending to the concept of managed code.   C# uses a garbage collection mechanism to release memory and resources that are no longer referenced in the application code, helping to prevent memory leak issues.

1. Strongly-typed  - the languages enforces type checking on objects in the code meaning it is type-safe
2. Object-oriented - C# offers the developer all the tenets of OOP such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
3. Component-oriented - C# permits the creation of software components for self-contained, self-describing packages of functionality
4. Unified type system - all C# types, from primitive to reference types, inherit from a single root known as Object

#Visual Studio

Visual Studio is the preferred tool for most programmers who are writing code in C#.  Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that offers many features designed to make your coding chores much easier.  With Visual Studio you will enjoy color syntax and code formatting which makes it easier to see keywords and code structure.  Intellisense and code completion save you time in wirting code and looking up method signatures.

Visual Studio includes integrated debugging facilities to help you troubleshoot your code when things go wrong.

Visual Studio 2013 and later offers Peek Definition that allows you to view and edit code in other files in the project, without losing your place in the current code listing.

You can manage your entire solution, which may include multiple project files, all from within Visual Studio.  Deployment of your applications is also easy using Visual Studio, whether you are deploying to a mobile device, a Web server, or the cloud.
